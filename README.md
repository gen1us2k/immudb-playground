# immudb-playground

A simple demo inspired by immudb blog post to store k8s events immutable. 

## Description
The operator reads all events in a Kubernetes cluster and stores them in immudb vault.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).


## Running it outside of the K8s cluster

It uses the default kubeconfig stored in `~/.kube/config` for authentication and requires reading events permission across all namespaces 

```
export IMMUDB_API_KEY=your_key
go run main.go
```
